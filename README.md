About:
In this project, I explored Bootstrap 5 to create a responsive and clean webpage. Bootstrap 5 allows me to save time by utilizing its built-in CSS, giving the webpage a pleasant and modern feel. While Bootstrap isnâ€™t the ultimate solution for all CSS needs, it provides developers with an excellent starting point. This allows me to spend less time on basic CSS and focus on refining the finer details within a web page.
