About:
In this project, I explored Bootstrap 5 to create a responsive and clean webpage, leveraging its built-in CSS components. Bootstrap 5 allows me to save time by providing a pleasant and modern design out of the box. While it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution for all CSS needs, it serves as an excellent starting point for developers. This frees me up to focus on refining the finer details within the web page.

I’ve updated my services using Bootstrap cards for a cleaner and more dynamic feel. Additionally, I transformed my photo gallery from side-by-side pictures to a slideshow. The buttons now have a hover effect that changes colors. And of course, I’ve added a navigation bar—a must-have for any website. When screen sizes shrink, the navigation bar switches to a dropdown menu upon clicking.

Overall, Bootstrap 5 has been a valuable tool in streamlining my web development process!
